# DPLL Project
## Overview
The DPLL Project is a dedicated circuit design initiative developed on the OpenMPW platform, focusing on the design and implementation of a Digital Phase-Locked Loop (DPLL). This project leverages the principles of phase alignment and frequency control, offering a robust solution for accurate timing and signal processing.

## Key Features
- Digital Phase-Locked Loop (DPLL) Implementation: Ensures high precision in clock synchronization and signal shaping.
- Application Versatility: The DPLL design caters to applications requiring precise clock generation and signal modulation.
